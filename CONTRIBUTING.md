# Contributing

We'd love to have new examples being contributed to this repository.

## Steps

- open an issue to discuss the example
- submit a PR

## Example Structure

Every example should live within a dedicated folder created at the root of this repository and being completely self-contained.

The folder should contain a `README.md` file with the following section

```markdown
# Example Title

Add a monorepo type badge (see examples later)

Write a short, one sentence description of the example.

## What's inside?

Outline the structure of the example, the relevant part people should go and look at etc.

## How to run it

Describe how to run the examples. Like specific Nx commands the viewer might want to run/try.

## Learn more

This is a section of bullet points with more info, pointing to Nx docs, blog posts, videos etc.
```

Add a badge to your example README that defines the type of Nx workspace setup:
