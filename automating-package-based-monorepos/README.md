# Using Nx Generators to Automate Package Scaffolding for PNPM workspaces

## What's inside?

This contains a simple example of a PNPM workspaces based monorepo (note: you can just swap it with NPM or Yarn workspace if you prefer those). The workspace contains

- a single React library `ui`
- a local [Nx Plugin](https://nx.dev/plugins/intro/getting-started#create-a-local-plugin) in the `automation` package, that comes with a generator to scaffold new React libraries following the setup of `ui`.

## How to run it

You can just run operations with Nx such as

- building all projects: `pnpm nx run-many -t build`
- building just a single project: `pnpm nx build ui`

And you can also use the generator to scaffold new React libraries:

```
pnpm nx g automation:reactlib mynewreactlib
```
