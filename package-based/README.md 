## What's inside?

The example contains two simple packages (`is-even` and `is-odd`) and demonstrates how to locally link these packages by leveraging [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/using-npm/workspaces).

## How to run it

Install all dependencies using `npm install`. You can then run commands Like

- `npx nx build is-even` to run the build for just the `is-even` package
- `npx nx run-many --target=build` to run the `build` target for all packages in the workspaces
- you can use `npx nx graph` to visualize the structure
