## What's inside?

Leverages the [@nrwl/js](https://nx.dev/packages/js) Nx plugin to setup an integrated monorepo with two packages, `is-even` and `is-odd`.

## How to run it

Install all dependencies using `npm install`. You can then run commands Like

- `npx nx build is-even` to run the build for just the `is-even` package
- `npx nx run-many --target=build` to run the `build` target for all packages in the workspaces
- you can use `npx nx graph` to visualize the structure
